The Binary-search-tree property allows us to print out all the keys in a binary search tree in sorted order by a simple
recursive algorithm, called an "inorder tree walk".

Algo:
INORDER-TREE-WALK(x)
  if x!= NIL
    INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.left)
    print x.key
    INORDER-TREE-WALK(x.right)
    
# here x is the pointer to a node, the earliest being the top node
